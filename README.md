# Python PIN Cracker

This is a simple brute-force PIN cracker written in Python for educational purposes. It demonstrates how brute-force attacks work (in a controlled and ethical way).

## How it Works

The script tries every possible 4-digit PIN combination from 0000 to 9999 to find the correct one.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run the Python script:

- Bash -
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/python-pin-cracker.git
cd python-pin-cracker
python src/pin_cracker.py
